  <h5>A few notes before we begin:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>if Ruixin seems fruity to you, that's because she does to everyone else, too.</li>
    <li>don't cancel me for bisexual erasure this is shitposting ok??????</li>
    <li>Don't sue me thank you very much.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Part 1: sexuality tests</h3>
  <p>disclaimer: these are very accurate as we know... yeah...totally</p>
  <img src="quadrants.jpg" alt="Ruixin is squarely bisexual">
  <p>as you can see this is very gay behavior. as an asexual, i totally know what that means</p>
  

  <h3>Part 2: her boyfriend admits she's gay</h3>
  
  
  
  <h3>Part 3: general fruitiness</h3>
  <img src="basement.jpg" alt='lol'>
