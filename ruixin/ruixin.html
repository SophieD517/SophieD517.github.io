  <h1>Ruixin is Gay Masterpost</h1>

  <p>in classic internet shipping style</p>
  <p>yes I learned this on tumblr bye-</p>


  <h5>A few notes before we begin:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>if Ruixin seems fruity to you, that's because she does to everyone else, too.</li>
    <li>don't cancel me for bisexual erasure this is shitposting ok??????</li>
    <li>Don't sue me thank you very much.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Part 1: sexuality tests</h3>
  <p>disclaimer: these are very accurate as we know... yeah...totally</p>
  <img src="quadrants.jpg" alt="Ruixin is squarely bisexual">
  <p>as you can see this is very gay behavior. as an asexual, i totally know what that means</p>

  <h3>Part 2: her boyfriend admits she's gay</h3>
  <img src="kiss.png"><p>i mean i also don't like getting kissed by boys. welcome to the club</p>
  <img src="bibibi.png">
  <p>what can i even say</p>
  
  <h3>Part 3: general fruitiness</h3>
  <img src="kiss2.jpg"><p>.......</p>
  <img src="honey.png"><p>if not fruity then what? condescending? i refuse to believe</p>
  <img src="basement.jpg" alt='lol'>
  <p>obviously straight people are all prudes so the very fact she knows about this means she's gay</p>
